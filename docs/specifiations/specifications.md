Building a dashboard requires:
Factors to consider: The task is left up to us to decide how we use data available to us and what analysis we want to do. It is necessary to consider that a user might not have multiple apps/datasets that encompass some of the things we might want to draw correlations between, e.g., user might only have data for their sleeping patterns, which would mean we cannot analyse how their sports performance is affected by this. As such we discussed a couple approaches to this. The first was potentially to use machine learning on other historical data of similar profiles so that we could provide a dataset for our missing parameter given we obtain a few details from the user (could be height, weight, gender, age etc.). Another idea was to limit our analysis to just using the given data from which we could provide some interesting insights (looking at someoneâ€™s sleeping patterns and recommending how they might improve their quality of sleep). We will also have to consider how the user is able to view data as the idea is to create a custom dashboard for users to select what they want to observe depending on what insights are available given their data.
