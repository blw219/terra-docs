# Context

The terra project 

- What's terra?
Terra is a startup which raised $2.8M in 2O21. The company provides a unfied API to connect all wearables. Health being a huge subject , it became importan for users to have an easy access to their data from multiple sources such as Garmin, Fitbit and Oura, in different forms and technologies. That's  terra's goal to  make sense of data, and give access to it in a structured manner, no matter the source.

- How it works
The user is able to choose their service login which allow heir health data to be automatically connected.

Best coverage, "we connect and add to our range of integrations with fitness wearables on a daily bases"

For developpers by developpers , our api and sdks makeit fast and easy to build great product and services
With just a few lines of code, you can integrate your application with Terra in an afternoon

Security by design 
data is anonymous neve stored and securely transfered using hmac payload integrity verifictaion


Having been recently featured in the arrticle , Terra wanted to be able to show their services through a web app which was user friendly and didn't require to be a developper .

- Our task : 
As developpers we were ask to build out a dashboard that would allow users to log in with their fitness account pull historucal data from the past few months and show them detailed insights about how their sleep sports performance has evolved over dfferent periods. Ths will be in the forrm of dynamic graphs, charts and auto-generated reports.
In more details we have to explore correlaions between these different metriics and provide analyses tto an end user of the differentt patterns that emerged. 
- Organization 
The idea is to create a website to view this on with the potential to move this to an app in the future. For the backend Node.js was agreed on while frontend would be implemented using React. We will also need to have a database which we can pull data from to display our analysis on the website. This will also involve authentication via the backend to ensure use of a Terra account. 
XWe divided the work into two teams : back end and front end but merged ll our ideas together.
Having 6 weeks to complete the projectt we had to keep a tight schedule
